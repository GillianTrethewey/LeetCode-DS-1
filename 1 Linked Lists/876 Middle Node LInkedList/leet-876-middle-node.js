/*
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

*/

  let fast = head;
  let slow = head;

  while (fast && fast.next) {
    fast = fast.next.next;
